# Unit 08 Project 1 Homework: Professional Materials

If you are opting out of career services, this is _still a required assignment_. Part of being a web developer means being a part of a community. Having a place to share your projects is _necessary_ if you're applying for jobs, but it's also _critical_ on your journey as a developer.

## Updated Portfolio
​

​
Your updated portfolio should:
​
<!-- 1. Display your full name, email, and phone number -->
​
<!-- 2. Have links to your GitHub profile and LinkedIn profile -->
​
<!-- 3. Have a link to a downloadable PDF of your resume -->
​
4. Display at least 2 examples of student work from either deployed projects or homeworks. For each project, make sure you have the following:
​
    * Project title
​
    * Link to the deployed version
​
    * Link to the GitHub repository
​
    * Screenshot of the deployed application
​
5. Have a polished, mobile-responsive user interface.
​
### Design
​
Unfortunately, this is where it gets a little bit subjective. Your site should look
"polished." Here are a few guidelines on what that means:
​
* Mobile-first design
​
* Choose a color palette for your site so it doesn't just look like
  the default bootstrap theme or an unstyled HTML site.
​
* Make sure the font size is large enough to read, and that the colors don't cause eye strain.
​
## Updated GitHub Profile
​
Employers (and potential collaborators) _will_ look at your GitHub profile, so put your best face forward. 
​
Your GitHub profile must contain at least the following items:
​
1. Professional profile picture
​
   * A photo or an image other than the default Github identicon. (a semi-professional to professional photo or an avatar photo are preferred)
​
2. Biography
​
3. Your current location
​
4. Email address
​
5. Link to your deployed portfolio
​
6. At least 2 pinned repositories:
​
   * Navigate to [GitHub](https://github.com/) and go to your profile.
​
   * Click "Customize your pins"
​
   * Click the checkboxes for your project and 2-3 homework assignments that you would like to share
​
7. Follow a few of your classmates. They are the beginning of your professional network and being a developer is as much about being a part of the community as it is writing code.
​
8. README files. Every pinned project should contain a README file with:
​
   * Title of app
   * Live link to deployed app
   * List of technologies used
   * 1-2 sentences explaining what the app is
   * 2-3 Screenshots / gifs of the app
   * License (usually MIT)
   * Contact information for you and any collaborators
​
9. Commit history. Every pinned repository should have at least 20 commits.
​
